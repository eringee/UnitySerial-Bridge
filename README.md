# A UnitySerial Bridge for biodataDuo

This C# script will allow your biodataDuo hardware to communicate with your Unity environment through the serial port.  You can change the baud rate and port name either in the script itself or in Unity's inspector. 


# BASIC SETUP

This code was originally created for use with Erin Gee's [biodataDuo](https://github.com/eringee/biodataDuo) hardware system for measuring physiological markers of emotion.

This being said you could probably use these two libraries to bring any kind of physical sensor inputs into your Unity project. 

# WINDOWS SYSTEM 

This code was made in order to avoid the Unity bug wherein the serial chokes in Windows OS


# UNITY

This code was tested originally on Unity 2017.2.0f3
