# A UnitySerial Bridge for biodataDuo

This C# script will allow your biodataDuo hardware to communicate with your Unity environment through the serial port.  You can change the baud rate and port name either in the script itself or in Unity's inspector. 

This code was originally created for use with Erin Gee's [biodataDuo](https://github.com/eringee/biodataDuo) Arduino-based hardware system for measuring physiological markers of emotion.

# WINDOWS SYSTEM 

This code was made in order to avoid the Unity bug wherein the serial chokes in Windows OS

# UNITY

This code was tested originally on Unity 2017.2.0f3

Just create an empty GameObject and add the script to the object, and you'll be ready to go.
